Context Mediated Graph Perception
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Examine the effect of context (knowing data describe cardinal directions, map info, etc.) and expertise (familiarity with compass navigation) on the perception of polar graphs


Perception Examples (Non-statistical)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Context Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_effect) - specifically, the effect of top-down processing on our perceptual experience. Familiarity with English letters and words allows the following image to be read without ambiguity: even though the middle letter in each word is the same, they are interpreted differently due to context.

Statistics/Graphs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [Shah & Freedman (2011)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01066.x/epdf) discuss the impact of two types of prior knowledge: domain-specific familiarity with the content depicted in a graph, and domain-general knowledge about graphs. 
    - domain specific familiarity: familiarity with tornado paths in the area, etc. In theory, compass knowledge could go here, so long as the viewer knows that the data is directional. 
    - domain general knowledge about graphs: compass knowledge could fall here too. The form of the graph would have an impact as well - polar lines vs. bars, area vs. density, etc.
